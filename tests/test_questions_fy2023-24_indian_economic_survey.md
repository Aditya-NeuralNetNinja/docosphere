These questions rely on general knowledge within the LLM's internal dataset:

1. Explain the concept of revenue deficit and fiscal deficit in the context of the Union Budget of India. How are they related to each other?
2. Explain the concept of 'fiscal policy' and its relationship with the Union Budget of India. How does it impact the overall economy of the country?
3. What is the 'Gross Budgetary Support' (GBS) in the context of the Union Budget of India? How does it impact the development of various sectors in the country?


## Hybrid Questions (Intrinsic Knowledge)

These questions could be answered using either the LLM's intrinsic knowledge or the uploaded document, but were answered using LLM’s intrinsic knowledge base to avoid unnecessary database calls:

1. What happened to India’s merchandise trade deficit in FY24?
2. How did India’s current account deficit (CAD) change from FY23 to FY24?
3. Was CPI retail inflation within the target range in FY24? What was the range?
